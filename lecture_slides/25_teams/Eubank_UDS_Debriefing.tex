\begin{frame}[c]{Debrief/After Action Report}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Constructive effort to learn and iterate
        \item Critical that lessons can be quickly put into action
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Thursday, we'll meet in our new teams and write Team Charters!
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Today}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify things you think went \emph{well} with your team. 
    \item Discuss \alert{why} you think they went well?
    \item Identify things you think could have gone better.
    \item Discuss \alert{how} you think you could avoid similar problems in the future?
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Today}
As you discuss:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start by going around the group and letting each person speak, \alert{uninterrupted}, for around a minute. Only after everyone has had an opportunity to speak should you start processing the issues brought up.
    \item Focus on solutions (``How can we work toward making sure this goes more smoothly next time?'', ``What can we do together to make a game plan for next time?'')
    \item Be honest and if you have concerns, speak up. At the same time, however, remember to speak to \emph{your} experiences and remember to be \alert{generous and cautious} in how you interpret the actions of others.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Remember the Fundamental Attribution Error and Naive Realism. 
            \item Remember also we're all trying to help one another.
        \end{itemize}
