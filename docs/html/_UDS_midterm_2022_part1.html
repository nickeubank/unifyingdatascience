I know this doesn’t <em>feel</em> exciting, but I hope you find this a useful opportunity to practice applying all the knowledge you’ve gained about causal inference over the course of the semester.</p> <section id=Causal-Inference-Fundamentals > <h2 id=Causal-Inference-Fundamentals >Causal Inference Fundamentals<a class=headerlink  href="#Causal-Inference-Fundamentals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2> <section id=Question-1 > <h3 id=Question-1 >Question 1<a class=headerlink  href="#Question-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3> <p>You are sitting in a meeting listening to a presentation to management by a colleague from the advertising department. In the presentation, your colleague is arguing that their model shows that if your non-profit—Let’s Bring Back the Dinosaurs—were to advertise on bus stop benches, it would increase donations to your project by 30%, radically increasing funding for your project to genetically modify reptile embryos by splicing them with remnant DNA found in mosquitos encased in amber, because that could never end badly.</p> <p>As you watch the presentation, another colleague asks the presenter how they know that their model is giving a valid causal estimate of the likely effect of bus bench advertising. The presenter explains that:</p> <p>“We got data on donations to other non-profts and their advertising strategies, then used the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >estimate_effect</span></code> method from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >DoWhy:</span> <span class=pre >An</span> <span class=pre >end-to-end</span> <span class=pre >library</span> <span class=pre >for</span> <span class=pre >causal</span> <span class=pre >inference</span></code> package’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >dowhy.causal_estimators</span></code> module [yes, this is a real thing]. Then we read off the”average treatment effect”. The package is from Microsoft, so we think it’s trustworthy! Plus it passed the robustness tests in the package, so we know it’s a valid estimate.”</p> <p>What response seems most appropriate in this context?</p> <ul class=simple > <li><p>☐ Excitement! It’s great to hear that someone has finally developed a package to automate the process of causal inference so that it can become systematized in the same way scikit-learn has systematized machine learning.</p> <li><p>☐ Mild skepticism. While it sounds like the team did some good work and knows what they’re doing, the only real way to get a good causal estimate is with randomization, so we should probably do more research.</p> <li><p>☐ Deep skepticism. You know that there are <em>no</em> statistical tests that can tell us with certainty whether <em>any</em> causal estimate is valid. That’s because the fundamental problem of causal inference is that we can never directly observe both an outcome under treatment and its counter-factual (outcome without treatment) for the same unit of observation at the same moment in time. Since we would have to observe both an outcome and its counterfactual to be certain of the causal effect of any treatment, this means we can never be absolutely certain of our causal inferences. The best we can do is look for stand-ins we think <em>approximate</em> the counter-factual condition (the outcome we don’t see) and use those to make inferences. But because we can never see this counter-factual, we can’t ever directly measure whether we have approximated it correctly, and thus must always rely on case knowledge to argue for whether our causal estimate if valid.</p> <li><p>☐ Optimism! It really sounds like this team did their homework, and now we’ll be able to raise more money so I can <em>finally</em> get a pet Chaoyangsaurus!</p> </ul> </section> <section id=Question-2 > <h3 id=Question-2 >Question 2<a class=headerlink  href="#Question-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3> <p>A random sample of American landlords were shown applications from potential renters and asked if they would rent to the applicant. Those responses—1 if the landlord said they would rent to a candidate, 0 if not—were then regressed on attributes of the applicant. The result of that regression is this table:</p> <img alt="regression of landlord decision on applicant features" src="_images/race_regression.png"/> <p>Does this show that there is a causal effect of having a college degree on whether landlords are willing to rent to an applicant?</p> <ul class=simple > <li><p>☐ Yes: the coefficient on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >has_college_degree</span></code> is large (it looks like the average acceptance rate was around 3%, so the +3% effect is quite big); the coefficient is very statistically significant (t-stat is over 4!); and landlords were randomly selected. So we can conclude that having a college degree has a very large causal effect on landlord behavior in the US.</p> <li><p>☐ No, while there are some controls in the regression, there were probably lots of other things in the applications that were different for applicants with and without college degrees.</p> <li><p>☐ No, the R-squared on this model is so low, we really can’t infer anything.</p> <li><p>☐ I really can’t say based on the information I have been provided.

But to be sure I would need to know more about exactly how the experiment was conducted to be sure that the randomization actually resulted in similar Black and non-Black applications, and that there were no unintended spillover or context effects.</p> <li><p>☐ No: there were probably still differences between the Black and non-Black applications.</p> <li><p>☐ I really can’t say based on the information I’ve been provided.
