    "# Making Potential Outcomes Concrete\n",

    "## The Study\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been approached by the Duke Office of Student Wellbeing. They are worried that due to the COVID pandemic, students are spending too much time sitting in front of their computers and not being active, leading to an increase in student Body Mass Index (BMI) scores (a measure of whether someone's weight is more or less than one might expect given their height) which might, in extreme cases, have negative health consequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "One policy they're considering implementing to address this issue is to replace all sodas in the dining halls with diet (sugar-free) sodas. But they aren't sure if this will actually make a difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help them decide, they wanted to measure the effect of diet soda on BMI, so they collected data on all Duke students, and compared student BMI scores for students who drink diet soda with those who drink regular soda (they're students -- they *all* drink some soda :)). \n",
    "\n",
    "They found that students who drink diet soda actually have higher BMIs (suggesting they may actually be *less* healthy). They interpreted this as evidence that diet soda is making students *less* healthy, so they changed their plans, and instead of removing sugary soda, they've decided to remove all *diet* soda from the campus.
