    "# Power Calculations and Experiment Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "When you read about them in a book, power calculations can feel very abstract. To make the concept more concrete, and to give you a chance to familiarize yourself with power calculation tools and the considerations that go into power calculations, in this exercise you will play the role of an experiment planner hired by a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) named [Bandhan](https://www.bandhan.org/) in West Bengal, India. Bandhan is planning to roll out a program that provides livestock, cash, and some basic training to households in extreme poverty. They hope to demonstrate the value of cash and asset transfers, and so wish their program to take the form of a randomized experiment, with data being collected on both control and treatment households.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job will be to help them estimate how many households they should enroll in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was, in fact, a real program, and so the data you will be working with comes from the actual program (conducted in 2007, with followup data collection in 2010, 2017, and 2020), allowing us to do some retrospective comparison of your power calculations and what actually occurred."

    "## The Context\n",
    "\n",
    "> Development economics has long posited that the poor may be poor for no good reason other than the fact that they started poor. This is the idea of a poverty trap, which has the implication that a one-time capital grant that makes very poor households significantly less poor (\"big push\") might set off a virtuous cycle that takes them out of poverty. Forty-three countries now embrace some version of this idea and make large transfers to over 3.1 million of their poorest households. In particular, the \"Targeting the Ultra Poor\" (TUP) intervention, pioneered by BRAC in Bangladesh, employs a multifaceted approach, offering poor households an asset transfer, consumption support, savings, and training in the hopes of unlocking a poverty trap.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [*Long-Term Effects of the Targeting the Ultra Poor Program*](https://economics.mit.edu/research/publications/long-term-effects-targeting-ultra-poor-program), Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Garima Sharma, 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2007, Bandhan in West Bengal, India created a pilot program to provide direct, unconditional transfers of productive livestock and a 30 or 40 week stipend of 90 rupees a week (about 7 US dollars a week using the [Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) exchange rate). The program targeted the poorest households in these villages based on range of criteria, and the average eligible household was later estimated to have a consumption level of about 1.35 2018 US Dollars per capita per day in PPP terms $.^1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the goal of the program was, in significant part, to demonstrate the effect of direct asset transfers, Bandhan identified twice as many eligible households as it could support in the pilot and randomly selected half of the households to act as controls and half to be treated $.^2$ Treated households were offered assets from a menu of options, from the most common choice was productive livestock (e.g., cows and goats). $^3$ Bandhan's contact with the households came to an end 18 months after the households were initially provided their livestock and cash transfers began.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although data was collected on a huge range of attributes of the households in this program, our focus will be on per capita household expenditures in 2018 US Dollars (PPP). \n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that these households certainly were not buying their food with dollars, and in most cases they weren't even buying most of their food with rupees — consumption estimates in this type of study are calculated by collecting detailed data on what household members have consumed in the past week, then estimating the price one would pay to buy those goods in local markets and using [PPP conversion rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) conversion rates to convert that into US Dollars).\n"

In this case, that variable is Per Capita Monthly Expenditures, and the baseline survey values of expenditures are in `pc_exp_month_bl` (the `_bl` stands for \"baseline\", meaning this data was collected prior to any households receiving asset transfers and indeed any households being assigned to treatment or control).\n",

    "[TTestIndPower has three methods](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.stats.power.TTestIndPower.html#statsmodels.stats.power.TTestIndPower) — `plot_power`, `power`, and `solve_power` — but `solve_power` does everything `power` does, so there are basically two methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of `solve_power` is that you give it all but one parameter of a power calculation — minimum detectable effect, number of observations, power, and p-value $\\alpha$ threshold — and it will solve for the omitted variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a quick flavor for how this works, set: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Minimal Detectable Effect (`effect_size`) to `0.5` (we'll take about the units of that argument soon), \n",
    "- `alpha` to `0.05`, \n",

    "- `power` to `0.8`\n",
    "- `alternative` to `two-sided` (we want to do a two-tailed t-test, as you could imagine social unrest caused by transfers could make people worse off).\n",

    "If you check the docs for `solve_power`, you'll see that you're supposed to pass `effect_size` the \"standardized effect size, difference between the two means divided by the standard deviation. `effect_size` has to be positive.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, when we passed 0.5, we weren't saying we wanted to be able to detect an effect of 0.5 2018 US Dollars (PPP) per capita per month, we were saying we wanted to detect an effect of 1/2 standard deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the standard deviation in our baseline survey was about 24 Dollars, that means we were saying we wanted to detect an effect size of about 12 US Dollars. \n",

    "\n",
    "OK, but is that what we should use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the idea of a Minimal Detectable Effect is that you want to set it at a level where (a) if this *was* the real effect when you rejected the null, you'd be happy you did the experiment and, presumably, would be comfortable scaling up the treatment, but also (b) if the true effect were any smaller, you wouldn't want to reject the null hypothesis and scale up the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, if you set this too high, you may run an under-powered experiment where you miss out on learning that your treatment was effective; if you set this too low, you're spending time and money collecting more data than is probably necessary given you might reject the null at a point estimate where you still wouldn't scale up the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what value makes sense here? That's a question you'd want to start off by asking the stakeholders. Since Bandhan wants to use this to promote cash transfers, they probably need the effect to be relatively large to be convincing. Let's assume that, three years after the intervention, they feel they need to show that incomes have increased by at least 30%. \n",

    "1. The poorest households were identified in two steps. First, residents across 120 village hamlets ranked households into five wealth quintiles. Among households ranked in the bottom quintile, Bandhan then verified eligibility per seven criteria: (i) presence of an able-bodied female member (to manage the asset), (ii) no credit access, (iii) landholding below 0.2 acres, (iv) no ownership of productive assets, (v) no able-bodied male member, (vi) presence of school-aged children who were working instead of attending school, and (vii) primary source of income being informal labor or begging. Households had to meet the first two criteria and at least three of the remaining five in order to be eligible for the TUP intervention.\n",
    "2. The [ethics of randomization in these types of programs](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/resource/ethical-conduct-randomized-evaluations) is subject of a rich literature, and there are currently an extensive set of guidelines used by researchers developing these types of programs.\n",
    "3. Of the 514 offered the livestock and cash transfers, only 266 accepted. The treatment estimates that follow are thus estimates of the effect of *offering* these transfers. Households that accepted the offers might differ systematically from those that do not, so the study simply compares those *offered* the transfer to those who did not). This is what's called an estimate of the \"intention to treat\" effect, and is thus *likely* an under-estimate of the effect of cash transfers that would be observed if uptake were greater."
