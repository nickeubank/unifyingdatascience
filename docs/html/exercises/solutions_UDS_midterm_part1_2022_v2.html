I know this doesn’t <em>feel</em> exciting, but I hope you find this a useful opportunity to practice applying all the knowledge you’ve gained about causal inference over the course of the semester.</p> <section id=Causal-Inference-Fundamentals > <h2 id=Causal-Inference-Fundamentals >Causal Inference Fundamentals<a class=headerlink  href="#Causal-Inference-Fundamentals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2> <section id=Question-1 > <h3 id=Question-1 >Question 1<a class=headerlink  href="#Question-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3> <p>You are sitting in a meeting listening to a presentation to management by a colleague from the advertising department. In the presentation, your colleague is arguing that their model shows that if your non-profit—Let’s Bring Back the Dinosaurs—were to advertise on bus stop benches, it would increase donations to your project by 30%, radically increasing funding for your project to genetically modify reptile embryos by splicing them with remnant DNA found in mosquitos encased in amber, because that could never end badly.</p> <p>As you watch the presentation, another colleague asks the presenter how they know that their model is giving a valid causal estimate of the likely effect of bus bench advertising. The presenter explains that:</p> <p>“We got data on donations to other non-profts and their advertising strategies, then used the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >estimate_effect</span></code> method from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >DoWhy:</span> <span class=pre >An</span> <span class=pre >end-to-end</span> <span class=pre >library</span> <span class=pre >for</span> <span class=pre >causal</span> <span class=pre >inference</span></code> package’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >dowhy.causal_estimators</span></code> module [yes, this is a real thing]. Then we read off the”average treatment effect”. The package is from Microsoft, so we think it’s trustworthy! Plus it passed the robustness tests in the package, so we know it’s a valid estimate.”</p> <p>What response seems most appropriate in this context?</p> <ul class=simple > <li><p>☐ Mild skepticism. While it sounds like the team did some good work and knows what they’re doing, the only real way to get a good causal estimate is with randomization, so we should probably do more research.</p> <li><p>☐ Excitement! It’s great to hear that someone has finally developed a package to automate the process of causal inference so that it can become systematized in the same way scikit-learn has systematized machine learning.</p> <li><p>☐ Optimism! It really sounds like this team did their homework, and now we’ll be able to raise more money so I can <em>finally</em> get a pet Chaoyangsaurus!</p> <li><p>[<strong>X</strong>] Deep skepticism. You know that there are <em>no</em> statistical tests that can tell us with certainty whether <em>any</em> causal estimate is valid. That’s because the fundamental problem of causal inference is that we can never directly observe both an outcome under treatment and its counter-factual (outcome without treatment) for the same unit of observation at the same moment in time. Since we would have to observe both an outcome and its counterfactual to be certain of the causal effect of any treatment, this means we can never be absolutely certain of our causal inferences. The best we can do is look for stand-ins we think <em>approximate</em> the counter-factual condition (the outcome we don’t see) and use those to make inferences. But because we can never see this counter-factual, we can’t ever directly measure whether we have approximated it correctly, and thus must always rely on case knowledge to argue for whether our causal estimate if valid.</p> </ul> </section> <section id=Question-2 > <h3 id=Question-2 >Question 2<a class=headerlink  href="#Question-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3> <p>A random sample of American lenders were shown applications from a set of entrepreneurs looking to get small business loans. All entrepreneurs had strong credit histories. Those responses—1 if the lender said they would lend to an applicant, 0 if not—were then regressed on attributes of the loan applicant. The result of that regression is this table:</p> <img alt="regression of small business loan decision on applicant features" src="../_images/loan_regression.png"/> <p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >has_college</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >female</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >poc</span></code> are indicators for whether the applicant has a college degree, is female, and identifies as a “Person of Color” respectively, and take a value of 1 if the applicant meets the condition.</p> <p>Does this regression table show that there is a causal effect of having a college degree on whether bankers are willing to provide a loan to an entrepreneur?</p> <ul class=simple > <li><p>☐ Yes: the coefficient on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre >has_college</span></code> is large (the average loan rate was around 45%, and having a college degree increases the likelihood of approval by almost +20%); the coefficient is very statistically significant (t-stat is over 22!); and lenders were randomly selected. So we can conclude that having a college degree has a very large causal effect on lender behavior in the US.</p> <li><p>☐ No, while there are some controls in the regression, there were probably lots of other things in the applications that were different for applicants with and without college degrees.</p> <li><p>☐ No, the R-squared on this model is so low, we really can’t infer anything.</p> <li><p>[<strong>X</strong>] I really can’t say based on the information I have been provided.

I mostly want students to pause and reflect, and then hopefully say about the fact that whether a model is providing a causal estimate is a function of anything in the data or any statistical test; it depends on how the research was conducted, how treatment was assigned, and on untestable assumptions that can only really be evaluated using case knowledge.

You know from past data that higher latency tends to reduce sales, so you’re hoping that the chip will reduce latency enough to justify its higher cost. In particular, you know that the chip will pay for itself if it reduces latency by 2 milliseconds. Any change smaller than that (or god forbid an <em>increase</em> in latency!) and the chips aren’t worth the cost; any decreases in latency greater than 2 milliseconds and you start to make money. 2 milliseconds is the break-even point, but we’d be making an additional 500,000 dollars a year in profit if we got to 2.5 milliseconds.</p> <p>Moreover, assume that changing chips is costly and hard to reverse (the cost in terms of parts and labor are taken into account in the math above, but the effort takes some time away from other things, so you want to avoid a change that won’t generate profits.) Given that, your team has determined that a p-value threshold of 0.035 is appropriate; choosing to roll out a change if you can’t reject the null with p &lt; 0.035 is just too risky given the costs.</p> <p>Suppose that after running the experiment, you find that (a) all your data suggests the experiment went well (everything you did in Question 9 looked good), and (b) you estimate that the chip reduces latency by 2.2 millisecond with a 96.5% confidence interval of +/- 1 millisecond.

If the 96.5% confidence interval is +/- 1 millisecond, then we can’t reject the null that there’s a &gt; 2 millisecond reduction in latency at p &lt; 0.035. In fact, we can’t even reject the null that there’s a 3 millisecond speedup, which would be worth way over 500,000 dollars a year!</p> <li><p>☐ Our standard errors and confidence intervals are too big to conclude much. We should really try and run another A/B test with more subjects to get much smaller standard errors, especially since the point estimate suggests we may indeed be able to make money, and the possibility of making <em>lots</em> of money is well within our confidence intervals. But if we <em>can’t</em> do another A/B test for some reason, then we should change to the new chips to try them out, since our point estimate is &gt; 2 and our confidence intervals include values that might earn us hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.</p> <li><p>[<strong>X</strong>] Our standard errors and confidence intervals are too big to conclude much.
