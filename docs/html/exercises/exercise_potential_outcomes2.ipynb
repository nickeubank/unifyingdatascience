    "## The Study\n",
    "\n",
    "You work for the HR department of a large company, WeMakeWidgets LLC. WeMakeWidgets is struggling because their health insurance costs have been skyrocketing, and they're looking for ways to control costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the past few years, WeMakeWidgets (WMW) has allowed its employees to enroll in a program where, instead of being allowed to see doctors in person, they have to first see a nurse via Zoom who offers advice, and then only sends them to see a doctor in person if necessary. In exchange, for doing these Zoom triage appointments, these employees are given a 50 dollar a month bonus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Employees who are enrolled in the program spend substantially less on healthcare than people not in the program, saving the company money. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, the HR department is thinking of making an initial Zoom appointment mandatory for all employees seeking medical care."
