    "# Marijuana Legalization and Violent Crime\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, many US states have decided to legalize the use of marijuana. \n",
    "\n",
    "When these ideas were first proposed, there were many theories about the relationship between crime and the \"War on Drugs\" (the term given to US efforts to arrest drug users and dealers over the past several decades). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we're going to test a few of those theories using drug arrest data from the state of California. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though California has passed a number of laws lessening penalities for marijuana possession over the years, arguably the biggest changes were in  2010, when the state changed the penalty for possessing a small amount of marijuana from a criminal crime to a \"civil\" penality (meaning those found guilty only had to pay a fine, not go to jail), though possessing, selling, or producing larger quantities remained illegal. Then in 2016, the state fully legalized marijuana for recreational use, not only making possession of small amounts legal, but also creating a regulatory system for producing marijuana for sale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Proponents of drug legalization have long argued that the war on drugs contributes to violent crime by creating an opportunity for drug dealers and organized crime to sell and distribute drugs, a business which tends to generate violence when gangs battle over territory. According to this theory, with drug legalization, we should see violent crime decrease after legalization in places where drug arrests had previously been common. \n",
    "\n",
    "**To be clear,** this is far from the only argument for drug legalization! It is simply the argument we are well positioned to analyze today. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Students from Practical Data Science: This should sound familiar! Last semester we did this analysis in a very simple, crude manner; in this class we'll do it rigorously with your new found difference-in-differences skills!)"

What is a unit of observation (a single row) in this data? What entities are being tracked, and over what time period? (This data is derived from raw California arrest data from the State Attorney General's office [here](https://openjustice.doj.ca.gov/data), in the \"Arrests\" category.)\n",

    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we will split our sample into \"treated\" and \"control\" on the basis of whether a given county had a high average drug arrest rate in the three years before California began drug legalization in 2010. Counties with high drug arrest rates, after all, will be more impacted by drug liberalization policies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate each county's average drug arrest *rate* for the period from 2007-2009. Then calculate the median value across counties, and create an indicator called `treated` for counties whose average drug arrest rate during this period was above the median average drug arrest rate. In other words, half your counties should be in the \"treated\" group, and half in \"control\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this indicator should be *time-invariant*â€”if a county is in the treated group, it should always be identified as being in the treated group. "

So if treated units are treated in 2008, then for the never-treated units, we are also comparing outcomes before 2008 to after 2008, even though 2008 has no special significance for the never-treated units). \n",
