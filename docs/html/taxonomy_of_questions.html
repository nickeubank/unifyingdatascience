To that end, we must begin by introducing a taxonomy of questions.</p> <p>To be clear, this taxonomy is my own, and thus you may not find that everyone you encounter will immediately recognize the distinctions that, by the end of this class, I hope will be clear to you. Indeed, part of the reason that data science is so fragmented is that different disciplines tend to focus (almost myopically) on certain classes of questions. As a result, they often fail to recognize that while the tools they use may be effective for <em>their</em> preferred questions, different tools may be required by those interested in different questions. In this class, we will strive to recognize the merits of all form of inquiry, and develop the skills necessary to properly approach any questions that comes our way.</p> <p>In this course, we will use a three-fold taxonomy of questions:</p> <ul class=simple > <li><p><strong>Descriptive Questions</strong>: Questions about the current (or past) state of the world. Descriptive questions are often about measuring things that haven’t previously been measured, or identifying previously unseen patterns.</p> <li><p><strong>Causal Questions</strong>: Questions about causes and effects – <em>why</em> does the world look the way it does? What <em>caused</em> the current state of the world? What is the <em>effect</em> of, say, a drug?</p> <li><p><strong>Predictive Questions</strong>: Questions about the future, or questions that require extrapolation beyond current data.</p> </ul> <section id=Positive-versus-Normative-Questions > <h2 id=Positive-versus-Normative-Questions >Positive versus Normative Questions<a class=headerlink  href="#Positive-versus-Normative-Questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2> <p>Before we dive into each of these types of questions, it is worth pausing to emphasize that this is a taxonomy of questions about how the world <em>is</em>, not about how world <em>should be</em>. That’s because while data science is an amazing tool for telling us about the state of the world, it <em>cannot</em>, on its own, answer <em>should</em> questions. That is because answering <em>should</em> questions requires evaluating the desirability of different possible outcomes, and that can only be done using on the basis of a system of values. Data science may tell us the <em>consequences</em> of different courses of action, but it cannot tell us whether those consequences make a given course of action worthwhile.</p> <p>To illustrate, suppose you are interested in reducing opioid overdoses. Your rigorous data science analysis may tell you that increasing the regulation of opioid prescriptions will reduce overdoses by some amount X and reduce access to opioids for those with chronic pain by some amount Y. But does that mean you should enact the policy? Well, that depends on how much <em>value</em> you place on patients with chronic pain having access to opioids, and how much <em>value</em> you place on preventing overdoses. And the answers to those questions simply can’t come from your data.</p> <p>In this course, we will refer to questions about how the world <em>is</em> as “positive questions”, and questions about how the world <em>should be</em> as normative questions. But be aware these terms aren’t universal. Some people use the term “descriptive” instead of positive, and “proscriptive” instead of normative. Since we are using the term “descriptive” for a different purpose in this class, I will use normative and positive throughout this course to avoid confusion.</p> </section> <section id=Descriptive-Questions > <h2 id=Descriptive-Questions >Descriptive Questions<a class=headerlink  href="#Descriptive-Questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2> <p>Descriptive questions are questions about the current or past state of the world. In the words of <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123412000130">John Gerring (we’ll read more of his work for a future class)</a>:</p> <blockquote> <div><p>A descriptive argument describes some aspect of the world. In doing so, it aims to answer <em>what</em> questions (e.g., when, whom, out of what, in what manner) about a phenomenon or a set of phenomena. Descriptive arguments are about what is/was. For example: “Over the course of the past two centuries there have been three major waves of democratization.</p> </div></blockquote> <p>Of all the types of questions we will study in this class, descriptive questions tend to be the least appreciated, but I would argue that in many ways they are the most important. That is because descriptive analyses are often the foundation for all other work. After all, it is only by first understanding the patterns in our world can we then move on to asking questions about how they arrose, or how they may evolve in the future.</p> <p>To illustrate, let’s consider a few important descriptive analysis:</p> <section id="Descriptive-Example-1:-Nope,-This-Time-Isn’t-Different"> <h3 id="Descriptive-Example-1:-Nope,-This-Time-Isn’t-Different">Descriptive Example 1: Nope, This Time Isn’t Different<a class=headerlink  href="#Descriptive-Example-1:-Nope,-This-Time-Isn’t-Different" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3> <p>A great example of descriptive analysis comes from economics. In 2011, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff published a book called <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/This-Time-Different-Centuries-Financial/dp/0691152640">This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly</a>. In it, they comprehensively analyze hundreds of years of economic history across more than sixty countries to document how, despite pundits regularly decrying that “this time things are different,” financial crises occur with remarkable frequency, duration, and ferocity. They offer some theories about why this may be, but their core contribution is documenting clearly that whatever it is that drives financial crises, it is not something specific to any geography or period, but rather something common to human economic systems the world over, wiping away dozens of attempts to explain specific financial crises as special cases in the process.</p> </section> <section id="Descriptive-Example-3:-Disease-Surveillance"> <h3 id="Descriptive-Example-3:-Disease-Surveillance">Descriptive Example 3: Disease Surveillance<a class=headerlink  href="#Descriptive-Example-3:-Disease-Surveillance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3> <p>It is hard to think of a public health discovery that didn’t start with disease surveillance – the practice of keeping <em>descriptive</em> statistics about causes of death or disease. Efforts to understand HIV began when public health officials saw a huge rise in gay men dying from diseases that shouldn’t have been fatal for young otherwise healthy men, and research into the role of cigarettes in causing lung cancer started when data showed that lung cancer rates were exploding across the world.</p> </section> <section id="Descriptive-Example-4:-Global-Warming"> <h3 id="Descriptive-Example-4:-Global-Warming">Descriptive Example 4: Global Warming<a class=headerlink  href="#Descriptive-Example-4:-Global-Warming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3> <p>Before we began to develop a rigorous understanding of the dynamics that were causing our climate to warm, we first had to become aware that, well, our climate was warming! Yup, yet another current discipline that began with a “simple” (I put “simple” in quotes because there’s nothing actually simple about measuring the temperature of the entire world over (initially) decades and (later) centuries) descriptive analysis: what is the temperature of the Earth, and how has it changed over time?</p> </section> <section id=Last-Thoughts > <h3 id=Last-Thoughts >Last Thoughts<a class=headerlink  href="#Last-Thoughts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3> <p>By now you can hopefully recognize the importance of descriptive analyses. Description is rarely the <em>end</em> of the scientific inquiry, but it is often the <em>start</em>, and without it, it is hard to imagine where we would be today.</p> <p>And while descriptive analyses may seem simple (e.g. Vera Rubin <em>just</em> measured the rate of rotation of stars in a galaxy, and Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff <em>just</em> documented every financial crisis in the past several hundred years) because they often don’t entail sophisticated machine learning algorithms or extremely complicated statistical models, in truth descriptive analyses are often extremely difficult to undertake in their own way. For example, because they usually entail measuring something that hasn’t been measured before, descriptive analyses generally require massive data collection efforts and innovations in measurement. And as we will also discuss in future classes, in some ways that put even greater demands on the researcher (and the researcher’s judgement and case knowledge) than some of the other types of questions we will discuss.</p> </section> </section> <section id=Causal-Questions > <h2 id=Causal-Questions >Causal Questions<a class=headerlink  href="#Causal-Questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2> <p>Causal questions are questions about causes and effects, and <em>why</em> we see certain patterns in the world. They often take the form of “What is the effect of X on Y”, where X could be a drug and Y is a disease, or where X is a goverment policy and Y is a public health or economic outcome.</p> <p>In many cases, as described above, causal questions are prompted by the answers to descriptive questions. Vera Rubin discovered that the rotational curves of galaxies couldn’t be explained by current physics, so now dozens of experiments are trying to find particles whose presence would <em>cause</em> the patterns she has documented.</p> <p>To borrow once more from <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123412000130">John Gerring</a>:</p> <blockquote> <div><p>causal arguments attempt to answer <em>why</em> questions. Specifically, they assert that one or more factors generate change in some outcome, or generated change on some particular outcome. They imply a counterfactual. For example: “The third wave of democratization was caused, in part, by the end of the Cold War.” It will be seen that descriptive arguments are nested within causal arguments. Both X and Y are descriptive statements about the world upon which the causal argument rests.</p> </div></blockquote> <p>Causal questions are, honestly, some of the easiest to come up with:</p> <ul class=simple > <li><p>What is the effect of minimum wage laws on unemployment?</p> <li><p>What is the effect of DRUG X on DISEASE Y?</p> <li><p>What is the effect of Iowa voting first in US Presidential Primaries on the types of politicians who become president?</p> </ul> <p>At the same time, though, they can also be awfully hard to answer…</p> <section id=Why-Causal-Inference-is-Hard > <h3 id=Why-Causal-Inference-is-Hard >Why Causal Inference is Hard<a class=headerlink  href="#Why-Causal-Inference-is-Hard" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3> <p>As we will explore in <em>lots</em> of detail, causal questions can be very hard to answer. To understand why, suppose we were interested in the effect of an increase in cigarette taxes that took place in Durham in 2019 on smoking rates.</p> <p>In a magical, idealized world, the way we would answer this causal question is by creating two worlds: one in which our causal treatment (e.g. the tax increase) was enacted, and one where it was not. Then we could ask “were smoking rates different in the 2019 Durham with a policy change <em>as compared to the world where no policy change took place in Durham in 2019</em>?”</p> <p>In the real world, however, we can never actually see both the world with the policy change and a world without the policy change <em>for the same unit of observation at the same moment in time</em>. In the language of causal inference, we can never directly observe our <em>counter factual</em> – the outcome that didn’t actually occur. This is what is referred to as the <em>fundamental problem of causal inference.</em></p> <p>To get around this fundamental problem, we must instead estimate what we think <em>would</em> have happened in Durham had there been no tax increase. For example, we might assume that Durham in 2018 (before the tax increase) is a good stand-in for a 2019 Durham without a tax increase; or we might think other counties in North Carolina in 2019 are a good model for what Durham would have been like absent a policy change.</p> <p>But because we can never see Durham in 2019 absent the policy change, we can never really be sure if we’ve modelled our counter-factual accurately. We can only use our knowledge of the cases and circumstantial evidence to <em>argue</em> that we’ve estimated is a good stand-in for our counter-factual world. And that, in a nutshell, is the art of causal inference.</p> </section> </section> <section id="Prediction-/-Extrapolation-Questions"> <h2 id="Prediction-/-Extrapolation-Questions">Prediction / Extrapolation Questions<a class=headerlink  href="#Prediction-/-Extrapolation-Questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2> <p>Finally, we come to what is likely the most trendy topic in data science: prediction!</p> <p>In this course, we will use the terms “prediction” and “extrapolation” pretty interchangably. Thus when we say “prediction”, we won’t just mean “offering guesses about what will happen <em>in the future</em>,” but also “what might happen if we consider cases that are outside the domain for which we currently have data.” That means that not only does building a model future stock market returns count as prediction, but so too does using data from a set of mammogram scans that have already been analyzed by human radiologists to build a model for analyze mammograms that haven’t been reviewed by human radiologists.</p> <p>Examples of predictive questions include things like:</p> <ul class=simple > <li><p>In what parts of the city are we most likely to see opioid overdoses tomorrow?</p> <li><p>What features of customers predict the likelihood they will actually buy something when they come to my website?</p> <li><p>What features of MRI scans predict alzheimers?</p> </ul> <p>In this course, we will discuss two general forms of predictive analyses: predictive analyses based on causal inference, and predictive analyses based on supervised machine learning.</p> <section id=Prediction-Based-on-Causal-Methods > <h3 id=Prediction-Based-on-Causal-Methods >Prediction Based on Causal Methods<a class=headerlink  href="#Prediction-Based-on-Causal-Methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3> <p>When one answers a causal question, one is generating an answer that, by its very nature, should be useful for prediction. If we run an experiment to test the effects of, say, statins on cholesterol, and we find that statins <em>cause</em> a reduction in cholesterol, then presumably we know what will happen if we give statins to more people.</p> <p>There are limits to this, of course – that’s why we’ve spent lots of time discussing the concept of <em>external validity</em>. A drug study that only examined the effects of statins on white men between 45 and 75 with dangerously high cholesterol, for example, is probably a good basis for predicting the effect of statins on a 65 year-old white man with sky-high cholesterol; but how likely is it to predict outcomes for a 65 year-old black man with sky-high cholesterol, or a 45 year-old woman with sky-high cholesterol, or a 65 year-old white man with only moderately high cholesterol? But with causal research designs, we generally have a well developed understanding of exactly what we’re measuring and how we’re measuring it, which makes it possible to think critically about the external validity of our conclusions.</p> </section> <section id=Prediction-Based-on-Supervised-Machine-Learning > <h3 id=Prediction-Based-on-Supervised-Machine-Learning >Prediction Based on Supervised Machine Learning<a class=headerlink  href="#Prediction-Based-on-Supervised-Machine-Learning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3> <p>In this class, we’ll treat all supervised machine learning (SML) models as tools for “prediction”, since in essence all a supervised machine learning tool is designed to do is to <em>predict</em> what the agent that labeled the SML’s training data would do when given unlabeled data. For example, what a SML model that is trained using mammogram scans and diagnoses provided by human radiologists if fundamentally trying to do is guess, when given a new mammogram scan, what a human radiologist would label that data. (Note: there are some machine learning approaches – like reinforcement learning – that don’t fit this model, but those are currently pretty rare in data science applications.)</p> <p>When using SML for predictive analysis, however, there are four very important concepts we’ll need to discuss at length: bias, external validity, resiliance to adversarial users, and ambiguous uncertainty.</p> <p><strong>Bias</strong></p> <p>As we’ll discuss, bias comes from the fact that SML models are generally just trying to predict the behavior of whomever labeled the training data used to train the model. As a result, if the people/process that generated those labels is shaped by human baises, this can be <em>deeply</em> problematic. For example, suppose a SML algorithm is trained on real world drug arrest data that reflects the fact that a Black citizen is more likely to be arrested for drugs than a White citizen despite similar rates of drug use. If that algorithm is then used in court to evaluate whether its safe to release someone on bond pending tiral, then that algorithm will say that a Black defendant is more likely to be arrested in the future (reflecting the racial bias in its training data) despite the fact that the Black defendant may be no more likely to use drugs than a White defendent, making it less likely that Black defendent will be released on bail.</p> <p>And to be clear, this type of bias doesn’t find its way into SML models because the people training them were careless in writing their SML; the tendency of SML to reflect biases is intrinsic to SML itself. What makes SML exciting as a prediction tool is that it’s designed to find patterns in the data <em>that programmers don’t have to identify explicitly</em> that explain variations in outcomes. But that means that so long as we live in a society where race, gender, nationality, etc., shape outcomes, SML algorithms will do their best to use these sources of variation because they explain variation. And the only goal of a SML is to explain variation.</p> <p><strong>External Validity</strong></p> <p>The second consideration when using SML for prediction is the issue of <em>external validity</em> and model fragility. As we’ve discussed at length in this course, <em>all</em> studies have potential limits to their external validity. But while its possible to reason about the external validity of the types of causal approaches to data science we’ve discussed in class up until this point, it can be <em>really</em> hard to figure out the external validity of an SML model. That’s because most SML models are black boxes, meaning we don’t really know how they’re making their predictions:</p> <img alt=xkcd_ml_pile  src="_images/xkcd_ml_pile.png"/> <p>While this is a strength of SML models in some ways – the model is doing the work of figuring out what is important and what is not without us having to specify it in a model – it makes it <em>very</em> hard to evaluate how well a SML model is likely to perform if we use it in a context that isn’t the exact context from which its test and training data was drawn. This isn’t always a problem – if you’re google, you can test on your users then deploy to your users – but if you want to use your model in a new place, it can be hard to predict model performance.</p> <p><strong>Adversarial Users</strong></p> <p>The fact that SML models are black boxes also means it can be hard to know how people may manipulate them when we put them in the world. As we discussed early in the semester, any time we want to use a study to motivate a change in our own behavior, people in the world may also change <em>their</em> behavior in response. For example, we talked about the program that only paid nurses in India if they showed up to work, and how (when the program became established) the nurse’s union created reasons for “excused absenses” nurses could use so they wouldn’t lose their salaries.</p> <p>But again, because we don’t know how most SML models work, it can be hard to predict how they may be manipulated.</p> <p><strong>Uncertainty</strong></p> <p>Finally, most SML approaches do a poor job of measuring the undercertainty of their predictions. You split your data, train your model, and evaluate how it performs on your test data. But how sensitive is that performance to the split of the data you used? If you split your data again, would your predictions change dramatically?</p> </section> </section> <section id=Conclusion > <h2 id=Conclusion >Conclusion<a class=headerlink  href="#Conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2> <p>This has been a quick tour of the taxonomy of questions we’ll be examining in this class, and some of the issues associated with each.
