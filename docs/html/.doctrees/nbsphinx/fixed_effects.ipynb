    "# Fixed Effects: Indicator Variables for Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "One common use of indicator variables are as *fixed effects*. Fixed effects are used when our data as a \"nested\" structure (we think individual observations belong to groups), and we suspect different things may be happening in each group. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a dataset of student test scores, and students are all grouped into different schools; or perhaps we have data on earnings and gender across US cities. In these examples, individual observations can be thought of as being grouped into schools or cities. \n",
    "\n",
    "One option with this kind of data is to just ignore the groups. For example, if we want to know about differences in the academic performance of minority children across the school system, then we might not want to add controls for students' schools because we think that part of way race impacts performance is though sorting of minority students into worse schools. If we added school fixed effects, we'd lose that variation. \n",
    "\n",
    "But suppose we were interested in understanding whether school administrators treat minority children differently, and whether this affects academic performance. Principles, for example, may be more likely to suspect Black children than White children. If that were our interest, then what we really want to know about is how race impacts academic performance *among students in the same school*. And that's where fixed effects are useful -- they let us control for group-level effects (like the fact all children in one school might tend to get lower grades) so we can focus on explaining *intra-group* variation (differences among children *at the same school*).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this regard, fixed effects are analogous in purpose to hierarchical models, though they are slightly different in implementation (differences between fixed effects and hierarchical models are [discussed here](fixed_effects_v_hierarchical.ipynb)). \n",
    "\n",

It turns out that if you aren't interested in the coefficient on each fixed effect, there are much more computationally efficient methods of calculating fixed effects.

As the name implies, `PanelOLS` is designed for linear regression (social scientists call linear regression Ordinary Least Squares, or OLS) with panel data, which is really any form of data organized along two dimensions. Normally a panel has data on many entities observed several times, so the first dimension is the `entity` dimension, and the second is the `time` dimension. \n",

    "The only catch is: you have to use `multiindexes` in `pandas`. I *know*, I hate them too. But the multi-index is required by the library for it to understand what variable constitutes the \"group\" for which you want to add fixed effects. Basically `PanelOLS` calls the first level of the multi-index the `entity` and the second level `time`. In this case, though, we'll just make the first level our counties, and the second level individual identifiers, then use `entity` fixed effects (and clustering). "
