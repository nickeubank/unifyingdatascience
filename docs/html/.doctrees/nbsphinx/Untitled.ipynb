    "So, you're working with panel data. You have either multiple observations per entity (usually data over time), or you have nested data (data on individuals, each of whom belongs to a larger group, like kids in a school). So you want to add fixed effects for the group or entity. But what does that mean from the perspective of causal inference?\n",

    "Let's start with an example: you have sales data for all of your stores each week for a couple years, and you're interested in better understanding the effect of new product releases on sales. When you release a new product, it usually appears in stores in different regions at different times, a strategy you use to make it easier to manage new product logistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you have a dataset where each row is a store-week, and you also have data on sales for each row, and whether that was the week a new product was rolled out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you start with a \"pooled\" regression, where you just regress sales on whether a store has a new product (with no fixed effects or hierarchical modeling). "
