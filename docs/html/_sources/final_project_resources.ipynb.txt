    "- [US American Community Survey](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/acs.shtml): the US runs regular surveys (called the American Community Surveys). Results of these are available for many years for small geographic units over a few decades. They include things like income, race and ethnicity, and both geographic identifiers (in tabular formats), and also GIS shapefiles (for GIS manipulations). Can be very useful for things like estimating consumer demographics in different areas. \n",
    "- [International Census Data](https://international.ipums.org/international/): Similarly, census data from over 102 countries is also easily accessible. This data often isn't quite as rich as the US ACS data (censuses have to be shorter than surveys), but still often has questions on health, income, race and ethnicity, etc. Also includes a lot of [GIS data](https://international.ipums.org/international/geography_variables.shtml).\n",
    "- [Wharton Research Data Services](https://library.fuqua.duke.edu/databases/wrdsinfo.htm): A huge database of business data. This data is NOT public (and is *very* expensive), but is accessible to Duke students through a Duke subscription. Note that if you use this data, you'll be able to share code and reports, but not your full project publicly, since the data can't be public."

    "Data from Kaggle or other competition sites. Part of the goal of this class is to give you experience working with messy real world data, picking your own questions and then sorting through all the data to find variables you need. Kaggle data and the like are pre-cleaned, and come with JUST the variables needed to answer a specific pre-determined questions. So absolutely no pre-curated data from competitions. "
