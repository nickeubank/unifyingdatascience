    "Here's the deal with programming: the *only* way to learn to program is to wrestle with solving your own problems. The [best way to learn is to do so *actively*](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/Active-Learning.pdf) -- if you just look at answers as soon as you get stuck, your process is more passive. You may *feel* like you're learning more, but research shows that that's an illusion -- [students who learn passively *think* they're learning more than they are](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/09/03/1821936116) ([a summary of paper is here](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/09/study-shows-that-students-learn-more-when-taking-part-in-classrooms-that-employ-active-learning-strategies/)). Moreover, in coding in particular, the process of debugging your code is a critical skill in and of itself, and the only way you will learn to do it is by literally spending *hours* working through your own problems. And once you've *seen* an answer, there's no way to unsee it, so preceed only if you absolutely have to."
