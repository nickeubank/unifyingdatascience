    "# Using and Interpreting Indicator (Dummy) Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We often gloss over indicator variables in our statistics courses, but not only are they (in my view) one of the most powerful tools in a data scientist's tool box, but I cannot tell you how much I see people struggle with *interpreting* indicator variables in their regressions. So in this tutorial, I'll try to give them the treatment they deserve, and hoepfully by the end, you've have a firm understanding not only of how to use Indicator Variables, but also (and more importantly) how to interpet them."

    "## What are indicator variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicator variables -- sometimes also referred to as dummy variables, though I dont know why -- are variables that take on only the value of 0 and 1, and are used to *indicate* whether a given observation belongs to a discrete category in a way that can be used in regression models. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, indicator variables can be used to indicate if an survey respondent is a woman (if the variable is 1 for women, 0 otherwise) or a Democrat (if the variable is 1 for democrats, 0 otherwise). In addition, as discussed in more detail below, a collection of indicator variables can also be used for categorical variables that take on more than 2 variables -- for example, a *collection* of indicator variables can be used to represented individual's political party registration.
