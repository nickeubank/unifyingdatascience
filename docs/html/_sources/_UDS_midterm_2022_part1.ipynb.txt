    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "You are sitting in a meeting listening to a presentation to management by a colleague from the advertising department. In the presentation, your colleague is arguing that their model shows that if your non-profit—Let's Bring Back the Dinosaurs—were to advertise on bus stop benches, it would increase donations to your project by 30%, radically increasing funding for your project to genetically modify reptile embryos by splicing them with remnant DNA found in mosquitos encased in amber, because that could never end badly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you watch the presentation, another colleague asks the presenter how they know that their model is giving a valid causal estimate of the likely effect of bus bench advertising. The presenter explains that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We got data on donations to other non-profts and their advertising strategies, then used the `estimate_effect` method from the `DoWhy: An end-to-end library for causal inference` package's `dowhy.causal_estimators` module [yes, this is a real thing]. Then we read off the \"average treatment effect\". The package is from Microsoft, so we think it's trustworthy! Plus it passed the robustness tests in the package, so we know it's a valid estimate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What response seems most appropriate in this context?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Excitement! It's great to hear that someone has finally developed a package to automate the process of causal inference so that it can become systematized in the same way scikit-learn has systematized machine learning.\n",
    "- [ ] Mild skepticism. While it sounds like the team did some good work and knows what they're doing, the only real way to get a good causal estimate is with randomization, so we should probably do more research.\n",
    "- [ ] Deep skepticism. You know that there are *no* statistical tests that can tell us with certainty whether *any* causal estimate is valid. That's because the fundamental problem of causal inference is that we can never directly observe both an outcome under treatment and its counter-factual (outcome without treatment) for the same unit of observation at the same moment in time. Since we would have to observe both an outcome and its counterfactual to be certain of the causal effect of any treatment, this means we can never be absolutely certain of our causal inferences. The best we can do is look for stand-ins we think *approximate* the counter-factual condition (the outcome we don't see) and use those to make inferences. But because we can never see this counter-factual, we can't ever directly measure whether we have approximated it correctly, and thus must always rely on case knowledge to argue for whether our causal estimate if valid.\n",
    "- [ ] Optimism! It really sounds like this team did their homework, and now we'll be able to raise more money so I can *finally* get a pet Chaoyangsaurus!\n"
