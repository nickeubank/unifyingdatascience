    "# Researcher Discretion in Descriptive Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "More than anything else, the goal of descriptive analyses is to extract patterns from otherwise incomprehensably messy data. \n",
    "\n",
    "But intrinsic to this is choosing what constitutes a pattern (and is thus something worth reporting), and what information can be safely discarded. Descriptive analysis, in other words, *always* entails setting aside lots of information -- indeed, the only way to *not* set aside information would be to literally hand your original dataset over to the reader. All summarization for descriptive analysis -- be that reporting summary statistics and  plotting simple distributions, or running sophisticated clustering algorithms or dimensionality reduction tools -- therefore requires the researcher to decide what is and what is not important. \n",
    "\n",
    "But herein lies the hazard of descriptive analysis: because readers are counting on you, the researcher, to present the meaningful patterns in the data and filter out presumably irrelevant variation. And thus it is incumbent upon you to ensure that you are highlighting *meaningful* patterns, and only setting aside *irrelevant* information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem obvious, but in practice, this is often a place that students struggle mostly because tools for summarizing data will always provide an answer (whether that answer is meaningful or not), and so it can be very easy to relax and just report standard sets of summary statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, for example, you have been asked to evaluate the performance of an instructor. You recieve that professor's final exam scores, and you find that the average grade in the class was an 85. Great! Sounds like things are going well. But if the actual grades in the class were bimodal, and all the grades in the class were either 100 or 0, then that summary statistic really isn't tell a meaningful story. \n"
