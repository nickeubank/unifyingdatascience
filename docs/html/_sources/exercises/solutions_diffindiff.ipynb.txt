    "# Groupby and Arrest Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, many US states have decided to legalize the use of marijuana. \n",
    "\n",
    "When these ideas were first proposed, there were many theories about the relationship between crime and the \"War on Drugs\" (the term given to US efforts to arrest drug users and dealers over the past several decades). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we're going to test a few of those theories using drug arrest data from the state of California. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though California has passed a number of laws lessening penalities for marijuana possession over the years, arguably the biggest changes were in  2010, when the state changed the penalty for possessing a small amount of marijuana from a criminal crime to a \"civil\" penality (meaning those found guilty only had to pay a fine, not go to jail), though possessing, selling, or producing larger quantities remained illegal. Then in 2016, the state fully legalized marijuana for recreational use, not only making possession of small amounts legal, but also creating a regulatory system for producing marijuana for sale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Proponents of drug legalization have long argued that the war on drugs contributes to violent crime by creating an opportunity for drug dealers and organized crime to sell and distribute drugs, a business which tends to generate violence when gangs battle over territory. According to this theory, with drug legalization, we should see violent crime decrease after legalization in places where drug arrests had previously been common. \n",
    "\n",
    "**To be clear,** this is far from the only argument for drug legalization! It is simply the argument we are well positioned to analyze today. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Students from Practical Data Science: This should sound familiar! Last semester we did this analysis in a very simple, crude manner; in this class we'll do it rigorously with your new found difference-in-differences skills!)"
