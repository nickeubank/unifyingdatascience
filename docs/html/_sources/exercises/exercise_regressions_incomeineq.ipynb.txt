    "# Estimating Gender Discrimination in the Workplace\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we'll use data from the 2018 US Current Population Survey (CPS) to try and estimate the effect of being a woman on workplace compensation. Note that our focus will be *only* on differential compensation in the work place, and as a result it is important to bear in mind that our estimates are not estimates of *all* forms of gender discrimination. For example, these analyses will not account for things like gender discrimination in terms of *getting* jobs."

    "Begin by downloading and importing 2018 CPS data from [https://github.com/nickeubank/MIDS_Data/tree/master/Current_Population_Survey](https://github.com/nickeubank/MIDS_Data/tree/master/Current_Population_Survey). The file is called `morg18.dta` and is a Stata dataset. Additional data on the dataset and a codebook is that link, and more is available through the links in the associated README.txt, but for the moment it is sufficient to know this is a national survey run in the United States.\n",

    "Because our interest is only in-the-workplace wage discrimination among full-time workers, we need to start by subsetting our data for people currently employed at the time of this survey using the `lfsr94` variable, who are employed full time (meaning that their usual hours per week -- `uhourse` -- is 35 or above). \n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above, this analysis will miss many forms of gender discrimination. For example, in dropping anyone who isn't working, we immediately lose any women who couldn't get jobs, or who chose to lose the workforce because the wages they were offered (which were likely lower than those offered men) were lower than they were willing / could accept. And in focusing on full time employees, we miss the fact women may not be offered full time jobs at the same rate as men. "

However, note that wage inequality is likely to be especially high for extremely high paid individuals (e.g. most CEOs are men), so this will bias us towards slightly conservative (low) estimates of the gender wage gap. \n",

In this context, for example, we can add fixed effects for the industry of each respondent -- since wages often vary across industries, controlling for industry is likely to improve our estimates. \n",

    "When we add fixed effects for groups like this, our interpretation of the other coefficients changes. Whereas in previous exercises we were trying to explain variation in men and women's wages *across all respondents*, we are now effectively comparing men and women's wages *within each employment sector*. Our coefficient on `female`, in other words, now tells us how much less (on average) we would expect a woman to be paid than a man *within the same industry*, not across all respondents. \n",
    "\n",
