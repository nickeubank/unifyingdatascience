    "# Resume Experiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will be using a data set from a randomized experiment conducted by Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan, who sent 4,870 fictious resumes out to employers in response to job adverts in Boston and Chicago in 2001. The resumes differ in various attributes including the names of the applicants, and different resumes were randomly allocated to job openings.  To manipulate perceived race, resumes are randomly assigned Black- or White-sounding names. The researchers collecting these data were interested to learning more about how racial bias impacts job market outcomes by testing whether Black sounding names obtain fewer callbacks for interviews than White names.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get access to original article [here](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828042002561). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Download the data set `resume_experiment.dta` from [github here](https://github.com/nickeubank/MIDS_Data/tree/master/resume_experiment), or by doing to `www.github.com/nickeubank/MIDS_Data` and opening the `resume_experiment` folder.\n",
    "- For `python` users, use `read_stata` in `pandas` to load the data set; For `R` users, use `read_dta` in `haven` to load the data set\n",
    "- `black` is the treatment variable in the data set (whether the resume has a Black-sounding name). \n",
    "- `call` is the dependent variable of interest (did the employer call the fictitious applicant for an interview)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the data includes a number of variables the describe the other features in each fictitious resume, including applicants education level (`education`),  years of experience (`yearsexp`), gender (`female`), computer skills (`computerskills`), and number of previous jobs (`ofjobs`). Each resume has a random selection of these attributes, so on average the Black-named fictitious applicant resumes have the same qualifications as the White-named applicant resumes. "
