    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've completed your first full github workflow cycle! \n",
    "\n",
    "But truthfully, this was a *very* easy cycle. In reality, there are a few problems that often crop up, so let's explore what those look like now. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common problem we face occurs when the repository you're working on changes *while you're working on your separate branch* in a way that causes conflicts. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, consider the following situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You clone a repository, create a branch, and start making some edits to the code that reshapes the WDI data. For example, maybe you decide you want to use GDP per capita in constant 2010 dollars instead of current US dollars.  \n",
    "- While you are making these edits, someone else comes along and modifies the code that reshapes the WDI data too. For example, suppose they decide they want data from 2015 instead of 2016. \n",
    "- The *other* person's code gets merged into the master branch while you're still working on your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, *if* the specific lines of code that define what variables to use and what year to use are different lines of code, then when you go to merge your edits into the master branch (after your PR has been reviewed), then you won't have any problems. Github considers *each line of code* to be a separate entity, and so it will only compare lines of code you've modified to those in the master branch, and will just apply *only* those changes when you merge your PR. So no conflict!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, this is what happened above -- while you were working on your PR, the master branch you were working off changed with the other pair in your team directly edited the README file. But that didn't cause a problem for git, because it just combined (a) the changes made to README since you created your branch, and (b) the changes you've made to your data analysis file since you created your branch to create a new commit on the master branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "**But if the lines of code that select the year to use is the same line of code that selects the variables to keep** then github is stuck. It knows that *since the creation of your new branch* that same line of code was edited in both your file *and* in the master branch, and it doesn't know which one is correct. If it uses your version of that line of code, then it would delete those changes to use 2015 instead of 2016; but if it uses the code on the master branch, your changes to what variables you use will be ignored. \n",
    "\n",
    "So when it happens, github throws up its hands and says \"sorry, this is above my paygrade. There's a problem here I can't solve, so I need you to do it manually\". And that's what's called a merge conflict. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to get used to merge conflicts, let's cause one! Note that both teams will have to do a bunch of steps in sequence to get this to work. "
