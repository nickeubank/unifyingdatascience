    "## What is a Counterfactual?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the causal relationship \"X caused Y,\" where X is the causal factor of interest (independent variable), and Y is the outcome of interest (dependent variable).  A counterfactual statement follows from (or, is related to) such a causal statement.  The counterfactual is a logical statement about what outcome would have occurred if X had not occurred.  For X to have caused Y, logically it must be the case that the following is true: Had X not occurred, then Y also would not have occurred.  That underlined statement is the counterfactual statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find it helpful to first form a counterfactual question (embedded above) that leads you to the counterfactual statement.  This counterfactual question takes the following form: What would have occurred had X not occurred?\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a randomized experiment?\n",
    "\n",
    "A randomized experiment is the gold standard for making high quality causal inferences given that we live in a world in which the counterfactual condition is always impossible to observe.  In a randomized experiment we randomize our units of study (individuals, classrooms, states, etc.) into (typically) two groups.  One group receives the causal factor of interest (usually referred to as a \"treatment,\" with the group referred to as the \"treatment group\"), and the other group does not (referred to as the \"control group\").  The outcome of interest is measured in each group, and the causal effect of having received the treatment is the difference in average outcome between each of the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the groups are determined randomly ensures (by the Law of Large Numbers, a pretty cool statistical law) that although no two individuals from each the treatment and control group represent a counterfactual for the other, the entire control group on average represents the counterfactual for the entire treatment group.  That is, the two groups are the same, on average, except for the presence or absence of the causal factor of interest.  And thus, any differences on average between the groups in the outcome of interest can only have arisen as a consequence of the causal factor of interest.    "

    "## Identifying Counter-Factuals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**  Take the causal statement given and identify (a) the causal factor of interest, and (b) the outcome of interest.  Then state (c) the counterfactual question, and (d) the counterfactual statement that must be true for the causal statement to be true.  Finally, even if it is absolutely infeasible in the real world, very briefly describe the randomized experiment that would represent the best way of approximating the counterfactual condition.   \n",

    "(side note: while the randomized version of this clearly can't be done, and so this may seem unanswerable, there are ways to answer this kind of question causally -- e.g. [this](http://www.jasonlyall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Artillery_Final.pdf), [this](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3212804), [this](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/jns/files/statistical_analysis_final.pdf), or really anything by [Jason Lyall](https://www.jasonlyall.com/publications-data-2/).))\n",
