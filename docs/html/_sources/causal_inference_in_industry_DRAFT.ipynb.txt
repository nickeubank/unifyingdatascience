    "**The Role for Causal Inference with Observational Data in Industry**\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't think there's anyone who would question the importance of A/B testing in the tech sector today. It is used *constantly* to help companies refine their products, better target their ads, and incrementally innovate. \n",
    "\n",
    "But while A/B testing is definitely a skill a good data scientist should have in their toolbox, it's important to understand that it is not the be-all and end-all of causal inference in industry. In this reading, we'll discuss *why* it's important to learn how to think critically about causality when working with observational data. "

    "## A/B Testing Isn't Always Feasible\n",
    "\n",
    "The first reason it's important to not only know A/B testing is that A/B testing isn't always a tool you can turn to. A/B testing only works when you can efficiently randomize people into different treatment arms, and where you can do it at low cost (if running a test is expensive, then even if you want to run the test, you should be doing some analysis first to make sure it's worth while!). But this isn't possible for every decision, even in big tech companies. Here's just a handful of situations where you can't run an A/B test:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **You Don't Control User Behavior:** Suppose you want to know the effect of, say, following a specific person on facebook or twitter on user satisfaction. The \"ideal experiment\" would be to randomly assign some users to follow that person, and block others from doing so, but of course you can't do that! So you have to find other ways to compare followers and non-followers that accounts for ways they may be different in terms of user satisfaction. \n",
    "- **It's a One-Shot Deal:** Suppose you're trying to decide whether to run a super bowl ad, or open a second store. You can't A/B test these small-N events. \n",
    "- **Randomization is Bad Business:** It's one thing to randomize someone's landing page color scheme; it's another thing entirely to randomly show people different prices for your products -- customers wouldn't stand for it! Similarly, sometimes you want a big rollout -- like the launch of a new title on Netflix, or the premier of a new movie -- and an A/B test would interfere with that. (Not an abstract example: here's [Netflix talking about this constraint](https://netflixtechblog.com/key-challenges-with-quasi-experiments-at-netflix-89b4f234b852)).\n",
    "- **Time Horizons are Too Long:** A/B testing is popular in tech because you get so much data from users so quickly that they're easy to run *on short time horizons*. But if you're thinking about openning more stores across the country, you can't put your business on hold, pick a few locations, setup new shops, and wait for sales data; you need to get a sense of what's going to happen *now*.

    "## A/B Testing Isn't Always Legal or Ethical\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are all practical business constraints, but there are also ethical and legal constraints many people face. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you're at a social media company and want to study the effects of harassment on customer retention, you can't randomly assign people to be harassed! \n",
    "\n",
    "And even if *you* think certain experiments are ok, you also have to be mindful of what the public will say. In 2012, Facebook ran an experiment in which they manipulated the emotional valence of posts they saw in their feeds, showing them either more happy posts or more sad posts. The goal was to see how moods spilled over from one user to another on the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment was *legal*, but when people found out they were having the moods toyed with at random, they [were furious](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/).  Now some tech people would say that \"everything we do is to try and manipulate consumer happiness, how is this any different? And maybe you even believe that (though I think that, at the very least, deliberately showing people sad things means you're doing harm, which is a huge no-no in human experimentation). But it doesn't really matter, because it cost Facebook a lot of good will. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar issues happened with OKCupid when they published research on how they [manipulated people's dating profiles](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/technology/okcupid-publishes-findings-of-user-experiments.html). That, honestly, was a pretty standard experiment, but when it comes to messing with people's hearts... you have to be careful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, A/B randomizations aren't always *legal*. For example, suppose you're working in Human Resources for a company that wants to improve retention of younger tech wokers, and you want to offer childcare subsidies to employees. If that workforce is unionized, you *can't* offer a benefit to only some people within a specific class of employees due to union contracts. "

    "## Going Beyond Average Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation of A/B tests is that they're only useful for estimating *average* effects. But often in business, we need to measure the effect of the actions of a specific entity!\n",
    "\n",
    "In a lot of areas of business, it's increasingly common to hire outside companies to do work using what's called \"at-risk contracting\". In these arrangements, the company doing the hiring offers to pay the vendor if they achieve a specific outcome. For example, a hospital might hire a company to reduce in-hospital infections, or a company may hire a vendor to minimize the downtime of their internal network. \n",
    "\n",
    "(These types of contracts are especially popular in areas where the work the vendor is doing is very complicated, so it's hard to pay them based on inputs (hours worked) because those may or may not result in improvements in the outcome you want addressed, so instead you just pay the vendor for final outcomes).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In these situations, it's critical to both parties that there's a good way to measure the effect *of the vendor's efforts*, or someone will get over or under paid. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these circumstances, it's unfortunately the case that people often just measure outcomes before the vendor starts and compares them to outcomes when they're done. But of course, if the outcome in question has any kind of seasonality to it, then we expect the outcome to vary whether the vendor does anything or not, and so you need a better causal design (e.g. difference-in-difference) to take those types of confounders into account.

    "## Don't want to be limited\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another important thought: professionally, if you only know how to do A/B testing, you risk limiting your opportunities for upward advancement. Big companies are getting better and better at providing analysts with extremely user friendly A/B testing tools, which means doing A/B tests is getting easier and easier. Twitter, for example, has an [internal tool called Duck, Duck, Goose](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2015/twitter-experimentation-technical-overview.html) that makes running an A/B test a relatively low-difficulty task. Thus if all you know how to do are A/B tests, you may find it increasingly hard to differentiate yourself in the data science market.\n",
