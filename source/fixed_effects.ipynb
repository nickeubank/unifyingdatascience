    "# Fixed Effects: Indicator Variables for Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "One common use of indicator variables are as *fixed effects*. Fixed effects are used when our data as a \"nested\" structure (we think individual observations belong to groups), and we suspect different things may be happening in each group. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might have a dataset of student test scores, and we may suspect that all students at a given school will tend to have higher or lower scores by virtue of being at that school. Or we might have data on earnings and gender, and we may think that incomes are likely to vary across industries or different cities. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this regard, fixed effects are analogous in purpose to hierarchical models, though they are slightly different in implementation (differences between fixed effects and hierarchical models are [discussed here](fixed_effects_v_hierarchical.ipynb)). \n",
    "\n",
    "In their simplest form, fixed effects can be included in a model just by adding indicator variables for each group. To illustrate, we'll use data from the US Current Population Survey (CPS) on US wages in 2019:"

Normally a panel has data on many entities observed several times, so the first dimension is the `entity` dimension, and the second is the `time` dimension. \n",

But the multi-index is required by the library for it to understand what variable constitutes the \"group\" for which you want to add fixed effects. Basically `PanelOLS` calls the first level of the multi-index the `entity` and the second level `time`. In this case, though, we'll just make the first level our counties, and the second level individual identifiers, then use `entity` fixed effects (and clustering). "

    "As you can see, the coefficients of the `PanelOLS` model are exactly the same as those we calculated above, and the standard errors are nearly identical (there are a few ways to calculate clustered standard errors, so they aren't numerically equivalent). But the way `PanelOLS` added fixed effects was much more computationally efficient efficient, and in these situations, we don't usually want to see the coefficients, so they're suppressed. "
