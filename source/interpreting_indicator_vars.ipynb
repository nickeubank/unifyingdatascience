    "Oh, man -- Indicator Variables. We give them so little time in econometrics courses, and yet I can think of few topics I've seen cause problems for established scholars. So let's see if we can give them the treatment they deserve, and hoepfully by the end of this, you've have a firm understanding not only of how to use Indicator Variables, but also (and more importantly) how to interpet them.\n",

    "## What are indicator variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicator variables -- sometimes also referred to as dummy variables, though I dont know why -- are variables that take on only the value of 0 and 1, and are used to *indicate* whether a given observation belongs to a discrete category in a way that can be used in regression models. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, indicator variables can be used to indicate if an survey respondent is a woman (if the variable is 1 for women, 0 otherwise) or a democrat (if the variable is 1 for democrats, 0 otherwise). In addition, as discussed in more detail below, a collection of indicator variables can also be used for categorical variables that take on more than 2 variables -- for example, a *collection* of indicator variables can be used to represented individual's political party registration.

    "## The TWO things that you must understand when using indicator variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When you put an indicator variable in a regression model, there are two things you must always keep in mind about interpreting the coefficients associated with the indicator variable: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) The coefficient on an indicator variable is an estimate of the average **DIFFERENCE** in the dependent variable for the group identified by the indicator variable (after taking into account other variables in the regression) and\n",
    "\n",
    "2) the **REFERENCE GROUP**, which is the set of observations for which the indicator variable is always zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you always remember that the coefficient on an indicator variable is an estimate of a **DIFFERENCE** with respect to a **REFERENCE GROUP** (also sometimes referred to as the \"omitted category\"), you're 90% of the way to understanding indicator variables. \n",

The p-value for `age_x_female` tells us that there's a statistically significant **difference** between men and women in how turnout varies with age. But is there a statistically significant relationship between age and turnout for women?\n",
