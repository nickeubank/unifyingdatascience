    "# Git and Github\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is Git(hub) & Why Should I Learn It?\n",
    "\n",
    "Git and github are a set of tools designed to facilitate collaboration on code. They make it possible for multiple people (in some cases, dozens or even hundreds of people) to work on code at the same time without getting in one another's way. (Note: as we'll discuss below, git and github are technically two different things, but you'll almost certainly use them together, so I'm just going to call them \"git\" for now). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is no exaggeration to say that git (and other forms of *version control* software) underlie the entire world of open source software, and are central to the operation of nearly every tech company on the planet. Git is just a central part of how software is developed today. \n",
    "\n",
    "Git is less commonly used in Data Science, however, where people are often working in groups that are small enough they feel comfortable just keeping their code on Dropbox and trying to make sure that collaborators never work on the same file at the same time (in the hopes of never creating a dreaded `Conflicted Copy` file). But git and github have much to offer the modern data scientist, even if they only work on small teams and don't want to contribute to larger software projects. In particular, here are the main benefits I see for git and github in order of likelihood of relevance for an applied data scientist (the sort who answers ad hoc questions like an academic researcher, rather than writes data analysis routines into widely distributed software):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keep an archive of every version of your project:** Git works by logging the work you do on your project into a series of discrete sets of changes called \"commits\". Crucially, it remembers *all* of your commits, making it possible to easily go back to a previous version of the project any time you want. Suddenly discover that your co-author deleted the code for your favorite graph weeks ago and you didn't notice till now? No problem! You can easily recover the version of that file that existed before your co-author's mistake. \n",
    "2. **All you and your co-authors to work at the same time:** Git is *much* more forgiving when it comes to allowing people to edit the same document at the same time. Git treats each line in a text document separately, so if your co-author is editing the introduction of your paper (assuming it's in a text format like $\\LaTeX$) while you're editing the conclusion, git can easily integrate your simultaneous edits. Moreover, if you *do* both edit the same line of code or text, then git will help you resolve those conflicting edits in a very efficient manner instead of what dropbox does: create a `Confliced Copy`, and leave you to figure out what changes conflicted and how to integrate both authors' changes. \n",
    "3. **You can easily see what changes you're co-author has made:** Because git is organized around keeping track of *changes* (again, called commits), when your co-author makes changes to a document, git allows you to easily see *just the changes* your co-author has made. This makes it much easier for colleagues to be aware of how their project is changing to watch out of problems (e.g. you can easily see if your co-author recoded a variable in a way that is problematic for code you wrote later). For example, here's an example of a github report on changes a co-author made in a shared project, where the (red) text on the left is what the code used to say, while the (green) text on the right is what it now says. And github even allows you to comment directly on changes if you want:\n",
    "\n",
    "![git_diff_example](images/git_example1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Much more helpful than a Drobox \"\\[Name\\] made changes to \\[File\\]\" notification. :)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Allows you to contribute to open source projects:** This may not be something you're planning to jump into, but learning git will make this an option. If you find that a package you use doesn't have a feature you need, the ability to use git will make it possible for you to add that feature to the package, not only allowing you to do what you want to do, but also making that fix available to the broader community. \n",
    "5. **Allows you to make your project open source so others can contribute to your project:** The time may come when you want to write a software package and share it with the world. If you know git, you can also share that code in a way that makes it easy for other people to contribute code and improve that package. Open source isn't just for big things like Python programming language -- it's also used for lots of little projects, like packages for [simulating electoral boundaries to study gerrymandering](https://github.com/mggg/GerryChain), or tools to make it easy to [access campaign finance data](https://github.com/fecgov/openFEC) (sorry, I'm a political scientist, so I'm doing poli sci examples, but you get the idea). And you'll be amazed how many people contribute to these kinds of projects. Indeed, even these tutorials have a [github repositoriy where people can submit improvements!](https://github.com/nickeubank/programming4ds)\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, now the bad news: there's a reason I put so much energy into discussing the value of git before getting into how it works: learning git kinda sucks. I mean, it's not painful like [performing an appendectomy on yourself without anesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Rogozov), and it's not hard like quantum mechanics or geometric topology; it's definitely something anyone can learn. But there's no pretending that git is user friendly, and you're sure to have a couple of moments when you'll find yourself thinking (rightly) \"why on Earth did they do it like that?\". So before you dive in, it's good to have the expectation that there's a initial uphill slog to learning git before it becomes really useful. But I promise: it pays off *big time*. "

    "### Git versus Github\n",
    "\n",
    "As I eluded to earlier, though they're almost always used together, git and github are actually two different things: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `git` is the program that keeps track of changes in your code and helps you manage multiple people working on code at the same time. \n",
    "- `github` is a service that hosts a copy of your project in the cloud so you and your co-authors can easily share project changes. In addition, `github` also has a great interface for reviewing changes to a project in a user friendly manner, and it has an \"issue tracker\" system for hosting conversations about things that need to be done in a project. \n",
    "\n",
    "And when it comes to what is user-friendly and what is not, `git` is the kinda awful thing to learn, and `github` is magical. "

    "## Learning Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it's such a central tool in software development, there are *lots* of tutorials online for learning git, and it would be silly for me to try and write my own. However, I think most do a so-so job of offering users a general sense of what working with git is like. With that in mind, below is a simple overview of working with git, after which is a link to what I think is probably the best git and github tutorials I've found. Once you've completed the tutorials, please come back here to learn a little bit more about data-science-specific git issues (like how to put datasets into a git repository) in the last section below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Overview of Working with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 1: Please [read this handbook page](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) to give you a sense of the general reason we're interested in git and github, as well as give you an overview of normal workflows.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practicing Working with Git and Github\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 2: After that, please complete the [git-it](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron) tutorial.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike many other tutorials git, it asks you to do things on your own computer, not an unrealistically easy to use terminal in the web-browswer, which gives a more authentic experience. Just follow [the directions here](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron) to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the only downside to this tutorial is that it is a little *too* detailed in the directions for each step, so there's a naturally tendency to power through without thinking too hard. Please fight that urge -- we'll use the lessons from this tutorial in exercises, and if you rushed through you'll be in trouble. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Students who are using `bash` in Cmder should have git installed, so you don't have to use \"Git Shell\" as the tutorial suggests. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2:** MIDS students have been exposed to git before, and so should know the basics. If you're entirely new to git, then I would recommend one of the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "- do Parts 1 and 2 of the DataCamp [Intro to Git for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science) course, \n",
    "- following the four linkes under the \"Explore more Git commands\" of the [Github Handbook tutorial](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/#basic-git) you read above, or\n",
    "- reading the full [Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics) tutorial chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "## git-lfs\n",
    "\n",
    "On thing that's unique to using git for data science is that we often want to put datasets into our git repositories. Unfortunately, `git` by itself can't really handle datasets efficiently. To solve this problem, we use `git-lfs` (git Large File System). You can learn all about it [here in this 2 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLR1RNqJ1Mw)! \n",
    "\n",
    "## An Aside on Graphical User Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is most commonly used from the command line: the text-based interface for your operating system. There are graphical user interfaces for git, but most don't quite implement all of gits features, so most tutorials teach git as a command line tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any comfort with the command line, learning git from the command line is probably the best way to start. You can later move to a graphical user interface, but knowing how to use the command line version means you can always do anything git can do, and online help will be easier to find. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you aren't comfortable with the command line, you have two choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn the basics of command lines. I recommend first doing [the command line basics page of this site](command_line_page1.ipynb) including completing the [first section of this tutorial: Introduction to Shell for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell-for-data-science) (the first section is just called \"Manipulating Files and Directories\". Don't go past that section). \n",
    "- Try to find a good graphical user interface-based tutorial (and if you find one, let me know? I haven't found one.. :( ). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you do eventually want a GUI, I recommend either [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (very clean and easy, but can't do everything git can do) or [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (busy, but more powerful and flexible. \n"
