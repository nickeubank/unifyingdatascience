    "# Traffic Death Analysis\n",

    "In this exercise, we will be analyzing the effect of alcohol taxes on traffic death in the United States.  The data set used in this exercise, `fatalities.csv`, is a state-year panel dataset (meaning it includes data on multiple states, and the data includes several years of data for each state. The data contains 336 observations on 34 variables. The variables used in the exercise are defined as follows:\n",
