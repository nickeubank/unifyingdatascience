- Ying: The question was if we get a p-value that is 0.2 but the minimal detectable effect pass the boundary, how should you make the decision assume that we cannot rerun the A/B test?
- Paul (Peining): I don't really understand this idea of Winner's Curse.
- Emma: Power versus statistical significance. And cookies.
- Clarissa: "How does the "validity crisis" feel today in academia? How are incentives controlled today by Duke, for example? Are people replicating studies as often as they should?"


- Dorothy: For example, if we can only find IV that is moderately (or weakly) correlated to the exposure, how will it affect the estimation? And how do we usually identify an appropriate IV in practice?
- Tigran: What is "local"



- Instrumental variables / imperfect compliance
  - Scaling, and 2SLS
