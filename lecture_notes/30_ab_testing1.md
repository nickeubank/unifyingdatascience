## Start of class

- equivalence between A/B testing and experiments
- Exercise

## Set up for the next classes



- WHY is A/B testing so popular?

  - You aren't your clients :)
  - We have luxury of ability to test easily


- Why experiment and not just correlate?

Internal v. external validity

Internal: 
  - A/A
  - ATE
  - SUTVA
  - (Managed in network experiments)
  - Compliance
  - Don't stop because "statistically significant"


External:
  - Realistic?
  - Network effects?

--------------- 

What do we mean when we say "what is the effect of X on Y?"
  - Counter factual
  - How is this different from ML approach?
    - Suppose you run Zappos, and you show a discount offer to a bunch of people googling "shoes".
    - Some go on to buy things. Yay! So you look at who clicked and bought stuff -- they're mostly women in their mid-40s.
    - So you start to show the ad to all women in their mid-40s. Yay!
    - Or you take the ML approach: you build a model that predicts the likelihood of buying among people who saw that ad, pick your "prime targets", and show the coupon to them in particular.
    - What did you do wrong?
