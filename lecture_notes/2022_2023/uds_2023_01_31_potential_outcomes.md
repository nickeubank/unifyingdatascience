2x2 example

- Aditya:

Are all causal claims made on an 'on average basis' i.e. taking this drug reduces the risk of diabetes by 50% on average. Isn't it important to also understand the extent of what on average means? Maybe we should also share the upper and lower bound of effectiveness? A drug with effectiveness ranging from 40% to 60%, is not the same as a drug with effectiveness ranging from 0% to 100%. Having this additional information, could help make a better informed decision.

To randomize, sometimes it goes down to ethical problems. For example, the hospital example in class, whether to intervene for hypertension or not to decrease the chance of complications. Unlike other experiments summon volunteers. How can we actually assign people with normal or low blood pressure ranges to taking medicine for the sake of the experiment? If we shouldn’t, then how can we help the people suffering complications with high blood pressure with scientific evidence to back up the validity of our “model results”, especially the interpretations? Can we draw the conclusion if we only treat and control the high blood pressure group? This is one real-life question that I find confusing, like a paradox, but my intuition tells me there are some solutions to this.

4) Can you clarify if there is more than two outcomes/two options? What happens if there are 3 or more outcomes/options (i.e. the Oregon Trail)? It seems like we should be narrowing down to get the options to as close as two as possible.

1) The first would be that the potential outcome framework seems to only apply to people as complexity neural networks and reinforced ML models (like AlphaGo/AlphaZero) are able to use their computations to branch out and create a whole range of potential scenarios. Is this true or would a potential outcome framework be applicable to even sophisticated models?
