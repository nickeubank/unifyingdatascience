As speakers:

- Avoid placing blame (“Why did you do this?”) and focus on solutions (“How can we work toward making sure this goes more smoothly next time?”, “What can we do together to make a game plan for next time?”)
- Discuss what went WELL, not just problems

As listeners:

- Recap what’s been said to confirm mutual understanding/alignment (e.g., “What I heard you say is...”); then acknowledge areas of agreement, disagreement, and be open to questions within the group

As bystanders:

- Redirect if things get personal, Speak up for interrupted colleagues / pull conversation back
