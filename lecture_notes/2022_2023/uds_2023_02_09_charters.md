## Making space for introverts

Jiaxin:

One thing that I am confused about is how to form a successful teaming that includes four required behaviors as the reading mentioned, these are: speaking up, collaboration, experimentation, and reflection. Whether as a group member or a leader, everyone is actually responsible for building an effective group. However, because team members may come from different cultural backgrounds, life experiences, and have different personalities and habits, it becomes very challenging to coordinate effectively, especially during the less competitive college group work phase. Specifically, if some members are introverted and unwilling to reveal too much of their own ideas, the whole group may not be able to brainstorm in a full sense.  Similarly, for some students who are used to starting work close to the deadline, since the status of the team members is equal rather than like the upper and lower levels of the work, if the active team members push them too much, they may even lead to conflicts among team members. Obviously, there are countless examples like this, and they all affect the success and effectiveness of a team project, so we need to find ways to adapt to individual conditions. When we work in groups, it is really not easy, I want to know are there some tips that can help us as team members to create a good group working atmosphere.

## Intervening

Dingkun:

When conflict arises, it can be a challenge to determine the best course of action. I wonder if we should ask other team members to help, or if we, as the uninvolved party should step in and intervene on the spot? Cause sometimes things would become complicated if a third person join and try to make peace. But I believe if I were the third person, I would still try to diffuse the heated situation and “encourage difficult conversations” as the reading suggests. I wonder if things do not go well for the teammates who fight each other, plus none of them goes to faculty seeking help, when would be a good time for the third person to express her or his concerns to a higher level faculty?

## Space for learning (Kashaf)

Lorna:

Each member of this class possesses an array of strengths and areas for improvement. However, when we collaborate in a team setting, it is not uncommon for some individuals to dominate tasks that they excel at and overshadow others who are struggling in those areas. How can we structure our teaming and task sharing processes in a way that balances the strengths and areas of improvement of each individual member, while also promoting collaborative learning and personal growth?

Genesis:

I found the solutions listed out in the reading – framing the problem, making it psychologically safe, learning from failures, and spanning knowledge summaries – to be helpful in addressing interpersonal challenges within team dynamics. However, I notice that these actions really require constant engagement on the part of team members to address ongoing problems. In reality, some of the team members may be disengaged to start out with. Worse, when a person shows initiative and takes charge, they may unwittingly establish an unspoken expectation that leaves them with a heavier portion of the workload. I wonder if there are better ways to engage team members productively.

Eric:

I think that another core issue that is not being addressed here is that “teaming” is rooted in a specific value system, which may not be held by others. This is something to which the reading alluded, when people force a point in a conversation because of personal gain. No matter how much teaming one wants, it will never compete against peoples’ personal interests. How does one address this then? For example, some managers are pushing for a change in some workflow so that they are in a position to earn more promotions (without explicitly saying it). The other managers will continue to speak about other initiatives, but the aforementioned managers keep pushing for the change in workflow. How does one coax out the personal interest driving those conversation points so that the team moves forward? Deep down, we can all guess why the managers are pushing the changes. I guess I want to find a way to ask directly “Hey, do you want this change for the bonuses?” without degenerating the conversation into something ridiculous and childish. I realize this isn’t the best example, but I do want to know, in the face of conflicting priorities that will cause problems sooner rather than later, how to best address the inherent conflict of interests? This is where discussion or leader-like moderators who have a strong “teaming”, value system can steer the discussion in the correct direction.

I remember that I worked with a person, where he wanted to have his name on all the leading changes. It was obvious. He wanted the position of director, and every report, no matter how severely irrelevant, was generated to acquire this position. With more moderators, I wonder if this could have been avoided.

Also from the Edmondson reading, I took some issue with Figure 2.1 and its depiction of the Teaming process. Not because of what I think it gets wrong but more for what I might argue it omits. Shouldn't there also be some acknowledgment of a parallel process at the individual level that must be done to enable effective teaming?

As people, we can't just bounce from team to team (or maybe we can) without any thought to our feedback loops and cycles. Somewhere around the point where the team goes from "Reflection/Feedback" to "Teaming mindset adopted," there needs to be some kind of recognition for the role individuals and leaders play in that transition. I don't really think you can jump from feedback to a teaming mindset naturally, there has to be a synthesis stop along the way somewhere for the team to make sense of what it is learning.

Or maybe I'm crazy.

## Leader

Ya-Yun (Wafi, Petrick)

I find that nowhere in the Team Charter Assignment requires us to select a leader for the team confusing. After reading "Teaming" by Edmondson and previous reading about teaming, it seems to me that around 50% of the key to successful teams is to have a good leader that will help to maintain good team norms. A leader can help encourage conversation or help the team identify shared goals. However, in our situation, is there a good way for us to pick a leader for our team? Should we list each other's abilities and then vote, or should we volunteer to be the leader? Should we have the same leader from the beginning of the project till the end, or should we take turns to be the leader every other month? I am just wondering that since we are all equal in this class and none of us is getting more salary or has a higher position than the other, what is the reason for a person in a team to take up a considerable part of the responsibility and put extra effort to manage the team?

## Hot/Cold

Dany:

From what I read, the article talked about how to avoid "Hot" moments and prevent emotion from taking over discussions but I think it's equally valuable to understand how to deal with situations become extremely emotional and tense and disagreements seem to take a personal tone. In my experience, the only thing that can resolve these situations is time but I was curious if there are other proven methods that can hasten this process.

Sukhpreet:

3. The reading pointed out that there’s a catch to conflict: it requires patience, wisdom, and skill to transform tensions into positive results. What is the indicator for staying patient vs being taken advantage of for a longer period of time because I can see this as a reason for much more heated tensions later.
4. When conflicts reach an impasse, the discussion often starts to get personal. But that isn’t professional (especially in a work environment). When does the setting also play a role in the conflict?
