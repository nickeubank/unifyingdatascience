- Weighting (Rachel)
  - One thing I was a little confused about was the weighted least squares. I was confused on why we would really do this. I understand that some states are bigger than others, so the change in deaths would be relatively different. Like 20 more deaths may be much larger of a change in Rhode Island, compared to California where that is a small number. However, is this not already controlled for when we use variables per capita? Does this do the same thing or does using weighted least squares do more/something else?



## End of Class

- Take 10 minutes and reflect on your team experience from the fall semester with respect to "team psychological safety." Were you in the Apathy Zone, Comfort Zone, Anxiety Zone, or Learning Zone? In what ways did you contribute to creating this team environment? Identify one behavior you will continue to do on your new team and one new behavior you will try to help establish psychological safety on your new team. Come prepared to share these behaviors with your team during class.
