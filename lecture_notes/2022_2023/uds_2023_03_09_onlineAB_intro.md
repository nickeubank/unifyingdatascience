## Vocabularly

- Overall Evaluation Criterion: $Y$
  - Measurable in short term, correlated with long term success
- Parameter (factors): thing being manipulated
- Variant: Specific treatments being explored
  - Discuss continuous, multi-arm, etc.
- Randomization Unit

## Hierarchy of Evidence

A simple hierarchy of evidence for assessing the quality of trial design: Meh. Only if we ignore external validity...

## Feasibility

- Randomizable units exist
- Enough of them
- OEC exists
- Changes are easy to make

-> Big emphasis on *marginal improvements*
-> Can't AB test a new social network

## SIGNIFICANCE

Local linearity
