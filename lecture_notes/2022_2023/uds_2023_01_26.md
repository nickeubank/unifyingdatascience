- EDA: linear regression --> stats, running --> sports
- Emma: one question came to my mind is that I feel like the key to improving the external validity does not lie in how we approach the data set but instead how can we gather a representative data set, which I think is less controllable for data scientists?  Iâ€™m wondering "to what extent should we care about 'external validity' especially when analyzing human behavior where cultural backgrounds and different settings, e.g. timespans, would have huge impact (and thus external validity is hard to achieve)?"
- Pragya: Something I am curious about is that to answer exploratory questions effectively, when we try to remove what appears to us as noise and irrelevant to our core needs, we may throw away information that we may need at the time of modeling. How do we draw a line on compromising too much data and information for the sake of simplification and interpretability when it comes to answering the exploratory questions.
