## From the bottom?

Jiaxin: (what do I do from the bottom) Juanjing & Charlotte also raised.

The point that confuses me the most is how we weigh the risks and benefits of speaking out in our future work, because the reality of professional work is different from our group work or projects at the student level, and speaking up may not become common anymore. Due to different position titles and levels in the company, when we are in a low position, we may take into account the risks of being outspoken, such as making the supervisor or the boss unhappy and being demoted or even losing our job.  Like the survey mentioned in the reading, which looking at how employees felt about speaking out, 85% of respondents said there had been at least one instance where they felt unwilling to bring up a concern with their managers, even though they thought the matter was crucial. I am also impressed with the example from the influential management thinker Nilofer Merchant about her early days as an administrator at Apple, she said "I would rather keep my job by staying within the lines than say something and risk looking stupid." However, we have to admit that bravely pointing out some mistakes in work or boldly proposing constructive and forward-looking suggestions to our superiors may bring great benefits, and the company may thus gain a better proposal, or such small bugs that are corrected that make the project more perfect, so employees who speak up are rewarded with bonuses and even promotions. The question is how do we weigh these two options, which is what I want to know.

- You won't always be; you'll usually be in the middle, and sometimes at the top!
- You can always help within a team.
- Something to think about when picking jobs/teams.

## Free riders

Chloe: (Follow through / free riding)

I'm confused about what to do when everyone is supposed to work in their own style, but they don't follow through. I've had people promise to meet deadlines, but then disappear and only show up the day before, apologizing. To me, teamwork is more about having the same goals and expectations for the outcome. Some people are more focused on other things like finding an internship or social life, and don't care as much about their work, they will be happier with people have the same interest. People who take their assignments seriously will be happier working with others who feel the same way, no matter what their working style is.

- Establish norms first.
- Voice violations of norms.
- Escalate.

Genesis:

I also want to learn more about some of the more productive ways we can address transgressors of psychological safety. How do we call out inappropriate and unprofessional behaviors without jeopardizing that trust?

## What do we have to share?

Lorna:

What more ways can we ensure that psychological safety accommodates the team's diverse cultural backgrounds, as these differences can have a significant impact on communication and interaction in hierarchical systems like the workplace?

How we balance the need for open communication and trust with the respect for personal boundaries in order to create a psychologically safe environment?

Xiaoquan: (Do I _have_ to share? What's objective?)

Wouldn't sharing one's personal life with the group, as Sakaguchi did with his illness, pose a potential problem that would undermine the professionalism of the work? For example, I think it is possible that if someone shares their illness or other personal difficulties in their personal lives, when they make some mistakes or contribute much less to the team, someone may say, "She/he is in a difficult time; we shouldn't blame her/him for that." From my point of view, I think it would be better if we were objective and evaluated work performance using the same standard.

Aditya: (Just professional)

While is easy to emphasize on the importance of having a social aspect to your work, it is sometimes the case that not everyone might be that receptive to the idea due to a variety of different reasons. How does one go about such a situation, where somebody wants a strictly professional relationship and does not want to go beyond that?

## Hierarchical Cultures

Kashaf (cultural issues):

This reading raised a very important question for me: how does psychological safety apply in cases where we are dealing with people from different cultures in a team? While maintaining open communication and being able to speak up is important for ensuring psychological safety, a lot of teams in real workplaces are spread across the world. A lot of times people have to interact with others from different cultures, languages and norms. In a lot of these cases, the social cues are different, how people deal with authority or leadership is different, how competitive someone is in a group setting is different in different cultures. For instance, in my culture some one who is older or has more authority is automatically given respect, even though in a team setting, someone who is older might have the same level of skillset as others. Another important thing I learnt from talking to other classmates was that in some cultures, it is common not to look at someone directly when conversing with them (which is not often the case in the American culture, which is more open and people like to maintain eye contact when speaking). Although we all do our best to integrate in a more global culture and work collaboratively, it would be too simplistic to homogenise everyone's experience and argue that just ensuring psychological safety in the same manner would make everyone feel part of the team. I believe that someone's culture background does impact how they behave with others and interact with people from different cultures. Some phrases might be common in some cultures but different in others. In my opinion, ensuring psychological safety for people who come from different backgrounds is a more complicated task and perhaps one simple approach might not work.

## Competitive Environments

Echo:

How can I build trust with my co-workers when we are in a competitive relationshipï¼Ÿ Sorry I may be a bit negative, but I think most people don't mind acting generous, kind, and understanding without violating their interests. But colleagues in the company, especially at the same level, have a competitive relationship, which relates to bonuses, promotions, firing, networking, etc.
