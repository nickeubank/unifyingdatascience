> I've been working at XXX in XXX. It's a brand new team so sometimes it's a little bit rocky but that also makes it fun because we get to set our own norms and we're all in the same boat. The first couple months I didn't do much *science*- was a lot of data cleaning and groupbys- but we're finally starting to get into some more technical projects. I have been thinking about you and UDS in particular a lot recently- as I have been asked to lead a test we're running next month. My class materials and especially the "Things to Think About Before A/B Testing" exercise we did has been my lifeline- so thanks for making us do that ðŸ˜†.
