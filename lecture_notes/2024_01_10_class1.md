Class:

- Draw arrow/line. Start with ML & modeling and representation of data.
- Add PDS: all the data work PRIOR to modeling and representation of data.
- Then add this class: everything before and after.
- Focus on causal inference

Two big ideas:

- Data science isn't just about model fit & the data itself
- Even when it is, often the provenance of the data is just as important.

Logistics:
    - Website
    - Slack
    - Quizzes & heavy reading for week 1.
